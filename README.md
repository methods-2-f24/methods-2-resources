# Methods 2: The General Linear Model

## Overview

This course is about regression modelling and its conceptual and mathematical foundations. The main emphasis is on *linear* regression and the *general linear model* (GLM). After familiarizing ourselves with the broader context and goals of linear regression modelling in the first three weeks of the course, we turn to the mathematical foundations of this type (and many other types) of modelling: linear algebra and calculus. The concepts covered here are essential to understanding the methods underlying not just the modelling we use in this course but also the approaches introduced in later semesters. Once the mathematical groundwork is laid, we proceed to applying everything in practice. Ultimately this will take us to generalizations of the GLM like logistic regression.

## Framework and tools

In most practical applications, we will work in the framework of Bayesian inference, which will be introduced at the beginning. Thanks to the modern software tools at our disposal - [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) - this is much easier nowadays than it used to be. For conceptual and practical reasons, this is the approach of choice. However, for a deeper understanding, we will also cover the *ordinary least squares* (OLS) approach to model fitting.

## Literature

The main textbook for this course is *Regression and Other Stories* by Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020), referenced below. Please get a copy of this. For the mathematical foundations, we will rely on parts of *Essential Mathematics for Political and Social Research* by Gill (2006), also referenced below. You can download the relevant chapters of this via the Royal Library.

Should you want to deepen your knowledge of the mathematical content, I can recommend the two companion books available here: https://minireference.com/.

## Videos

This whole course (with a few exceptions) [is on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvJwKACYy5_MTdnrzxx_1sN389dS9OB3S)! These videos are from when the course took place under lockdown conditions. This year, we're going to cover topics in a slightly different order, starting with an introduction to regression modelling before we go into linear algebra and calculus. This means the videos will be less relevant during the first three weeks of the course, but from then on, you can watch them in the order of the playlist.

## Flipped classroom

We will be using a so-called 'flipped classroom' in this course. This means that you are generally expected to have read the literature and watched the videos before coming to the lecture. The purpose of the lecture then is for you to ask questions (the more, the better!) so that we can go over the material again together, deepening and broadening our understanding of it.

## Slack workspace

In order for us to stay in contact, ask questions, and have discussions, we will use [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/methods-2-f23/discussions).

## Exam

- Portfolio consisting of 3 assignments
- Each assignment will require you to create an R Markdown notebook
consisting of a mix of text and code.

You will receive a (short) feedback message from us on your portfolio assignments that you can use for improvements before finalizing your hand-ins.
